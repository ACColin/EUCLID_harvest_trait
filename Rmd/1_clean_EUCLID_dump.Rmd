## Aim:
Harvest Eucalyptus species traits from botanical descriptions ("fact sheets") that are available on the EUCLID website <https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/>. In this document, I will clean up the raw data and get it into a state where I can begin extracting trait data from it.

Extract life-history trait information for the PGLS analysis on Victoria's CCA dataset.

The EUCLID data and corymbia_species.txt were obtained by extracting the urls from the .htm websites for Corymbia species <https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/index_corymbia.htm>.


# 01. Dumping the website

There is a webpage of all Corymbia species on EUCLID with links to their fact sheets at <https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/index.htm>. I downloaded the code for these webpages and used a regular expression to grab just the URLs to the fact sheets. Those URLs are in a plain text file in `raw_data/corymbia_species.txt`:

  `https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/corymbia_abbreviata.htm`
  `https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/corymbia_abergiana.htm`
  `https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/corymbia_aparrerinja.htm`
  `https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/corymbia_arafurica.htm`
  `https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/entities/corymbia_arenaria.htm`

Linux command used: `cat EUCLIDSpeciesIndex.htm | tr '"' '\n' | tr "'" '\n' | grep -e '^https://' -e '^http://' -e'^//' | sort | uniq > corymbia_species.txt`

Then I used `wget` <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/> to download every URL in the list:

    wget -i "corymbia_species.txt"
    
The downloaded HTML files were moved to `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_corymbia` and `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_angophora`:

  `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_angophora/angophora_bakeri_subsp._bakeri.htm`
  `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_angophora/angophora_bakeri_subsp._crassifolia.htm`
  `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_angophora/angophora_costata_subsp._costata.htm`
  `raw_data/EUCLID_dump_angophora/angophora_costata_subsp._euryphylla.htm`

The files can then be held in a big dataframe for working.

``` {r construct EUCLID database}
raw_pages_corymbia <- 
    # readtext may produce warnings if the files being imported are *.htm. 
    # That's okay because it imports them as plain text, which is what we want.
    readtext(list.files("../raw_data/EUCLID_dump_corymbia/", full.names = TRUE)) %>% 
    rename(name = doc_id, html = text) %>% 
    # The name field can be used to grab the species/subspecies later.
    mutate(name = str_remove(name, "\\.htm"),
           name = str_replace_all(name, "_", " ")) %>% 
    # Remove soft linebreaks and multiple spaces from HTML to make it easier to 
    # see what I am retrieving. 
    # I also replace the em dashes, which failed to encode properly, with --.
    # I also replace <br /> with a text equivalent ( -BREAK- ) because it is 
    # used in the HTML to separate parts of the description.
    mutate(html = str_replace_all(html, "\\\n", " "),
           html = str_replace_all(html, "\\s+", " "),
           html = str_replace_all(html, "â€“", "--"),
           html = str_replace_all(html, "Â°", "°"),
           html = str_replace_all(html, "<br/>|<br />|<BR>", " -BREAK- ")) %>% 
    # The HTML (as plain text) needs to be converted for use with rvest. It must
    # be held in a list column because rvest outputs a 2-element list.
    group_by(name) %>%
    mutate(html = read_html(html) %>% list()) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    identity()

glimpse(raw_pages_corymbia)

```

# 02. Isolating the sections of the fact sheet

It's lovely that the different sections of the fact sheet are cleanly separated from each other in the HTML.

```{r}
# Remove the linebreak placeholders and clean up extra spaces.
clean_text <- function(text) {
    text %>% 
        str_remove_all("-BREAK-") %>% 
        str_trim()
}


get_classification <- function(html) {
    html %>%
        pluck(1) %>%   # The HTML is in a list column and must be plucked out.
        html_node("div#classification") %>%
        html_node("div.content") %>%
        html_text() %>%
        clean_text()
}


get_nomenclature <- function(html) {
    html %>% 
        pluck(1) %>%   # The HTML is in a list column and must be plucked out.
        html_node("div#nomenclature") %>% 
        html_node("div.content") %>% 
        html_text() %>% 
        clean_text()
}


get_description <- function(html) {
    html %>% 
        pluck(1) %>%   # The HTML is in a list column and must be plucked out.
        html_node("div#description") %>% 
        html_node("div.content") %>% 
        html_text()
        # No clean_text() here because I need the linebreak placeholders later.
}
```

The output is like:

```{r}
get_classification(raw_pages_corymbia$html[1])
get_nomenclature(raw_pages_corymbia$html[1])
get_description(raw_pages_corymbia$html[1])
```

This can be applied to each entry now:

```{r}
raw_sections_corymbia <- 
    raw_pages_corymbia %>% 
    group_by(name) %>% 
    summarise_at("html", 
                 list(~ get_classification(.),
                      ~ get_nomenclature(.),
                      ~ get_description(.)
                      )
                 ) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

# 03. Splitting the description

Each part of the description that they have asked for (growth form, adult leaves, fruit, seed, and inflorescence) can be further split off.

```{r}
get_growthform <- function(desc) {
    desc %>% 
        str_extract("^.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
        clean_text()
}


get_adultleaves <- function(desc) {
    out <- 
        desc %>% 
        # Sometimes "Adult leaves" is inside the sentence.
        # "Crown composed entirely of Adult leaves which are..."
        str_extract("(Adult|Crown|crown|Mature|mature) leaves.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
        clean_text()
    
    # I try to search for "Adult leaves" first because for some species, the 
    # lowercase "adult leaves" comes earlier in the description and is 
    # wrongly retrieved instead.
    if(is.na(out)) {
        out <- 
            desc %>% 
            # Sometimes "Adult leaves" is inside the sentence.
            # "Crown composed entirely of Adult leaves which are..."
            str_extract("adult leaves.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
            clean_text()
    }
    
    # If the retrieved section does not have a number in it, it is probably 
    # because the juvenile leaves are the ones being referred to when the adult
    # leaves are described.
    if(str_detect(out, "cm (long|wide)") == FALSE | is.na(out)) {
        out <- NA_character_
    }
    
    return(out)
}


get_fruit <- function(desc) {
    desc %>% 
        str_extract("-BREAK- Fruit.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
        clean_text()
}


get_seeds <- function(desc) {
    desc %>% 
        str_extract("Seed.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
        clean_text()
}


get_inflorescence <- function(desc) {
    desc %>% 
        str_extract("(-BREAK-)? Inflorescence.*?(-BREAK-|$)") %>% 
        clean_text()
}
```

The output looks like this:

```{r}
get_growthform(raw_sections_corymbia$get_description[1])
get_adultleaves(raw_sections_corymbia$get_description[799])
get_fruit(raw_sections_corymbia$get_description[1])
get_seeds(raw_sections_corymbia$get_description[1])
get_inflorescence(raw_sections_corymbia$get_description[1])
```

These columns can be retrieved too. This dataframe is now ready for the trait extraction process.

```{r}
sections_clean <- 
    raw_sections_corymbia %>% 
    group_by(name) %>% 
    mutate_at("get_description", 
                 list(~ get_growthform(.),
                      ~ get_adultleaves(.),
                      ~ get_fruit(.),
                      ~ get_seeds(.),
                      ~ get_inflorescence(.))) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    select(name, get_classification, get_growthform:get_inflorescence, 
           everything()) %>% 
    glimpse()
```

# 04. Manually fix adult leaf section

There are 15 species that fail to split properly because they do not have a proper section for adult leaves. This is because the adult leaves are similar enough to the juvenile ones that the description simply points to what was already written for the juveniles. I will manually insert those juvenile leaf descriptions into the space for adult leaves.

```{r}
